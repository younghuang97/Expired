# expired
This will be a app that records the expiration dates of items you have purchased. There will be a locally stored database of expected expiration dates for common grocery items. It will come with both refridgerated and freezer expected times. This will be a useful tracking app, so the user knows what foods will be expiring soon, so the user knows what to start using first.
Backend will be coded in Java while front-end will be coded using Android Studio.
