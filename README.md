Built a lightweight Android application in Android Studio that tracks perishable items. Useful features include notifying the
user when an item is approaching its expiration date, pulling expiration dates from a remote database when the user is
uncertain of a specific itemâ€™s expiration date, and storing the data online to backup the data in case the information is lost
locally
